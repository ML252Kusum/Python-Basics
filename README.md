## Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java.

## What is Python?

Python is a versatile language used in various fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Its extensive standard library, community support, and ease of learning make it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

Key features of Python:
- *Readability*: Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, making it an ideal language for beginners.
- *Versatility*: Python is used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more.
